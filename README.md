# Linux_Embedded_Interfaces

Minimal Examples for how to use Embedded Interfaces from Linux Userspace

This repository contains examples for:

* SPI Interface with MCP23S08
* I2C Interface with MCP23017
* GPIO as Input and Output

I use a Raspberry Pi 3 for these examples, but it should also work with other GNU/Linux Embedded Devices (e.g. Beaglebones, ...).
