# SPI Example

For this example I am using a MCP23S08 GPIO Expander as a SPI slave and a Raspberry Pi as the SPI Master.

GPIOA0 is connected to a LED, GPIOA1 to a button.

Here is a link to the [datasheet of the MCP23S08](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/MCP23008-MCP23S08-Data-Sheet-20001919F.pdf)
